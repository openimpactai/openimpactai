# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At OpenImpactAI, we take security seriously. We appreciate your help in keeping our projects secure by responsibly disclosing any security vulnerabilities you may find.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in any OpenImpactAI repository, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

2. **Email us directly** at [openimpactai@aibuildershub.ai](mailto:openimpactai@aibuildershub.ai) with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report".

3. **Include the following information** in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any potential solutions you may have (optional)
   - Whether you would like to be credited for discovering the issue

4. **Allow time for response** - We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will send you regular updates about our progress.

### What to Expect

After you have submitted a vulnerability report, you can expect the following process:

1. **Confirmation**: We will confirm receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the issue.
3. **Updates**: We will provide regular updates about the status of the fix.
4. **Resolution**: Once resolved, we will notify you and discuss appropriate disclosure.

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow a coordinated vulnerability disclosure approach.
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue before any public disclosure.
- We will acknowledge your contribution (if desired) when we disclose the issue.

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:
- Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- Exempt from DMCA restrictions on circumvention measures
- Compliant with the Good Faith provisions in our site Terms of Service
- Exempt from restrictions in our site Terms of Service that would prohibit technical security research

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this security policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to OpenImpactAI projects, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Keep dependencies updated** to their latest secure versions.
2. **Validate all inputs** in your code, especially when processing user input.
3. **Do not commit sensitive information** such as credentials, API keys, or personal data.
4. **Follow the principle of least privilege** when designing access control systems.
5. **Use secure, well-established libraries** for security-critical functionality.
6. **Implement appropriate data sanitization** when dealing with user-generated content.
7. **Consider privacy implications** when designing features that collect or process user data.

## Special Considerations for AI Projects

As OpenImpactAI focuses on AI for social good, there are additional security considerations:

1. **Model Security**: Be aware of potential model vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, model inversion, or training data extraction.
2. **Data Protection**: Ensure training data and user interactions are properly anonymized and protected.
3. **AI Ethics**: Design systems to prevent misuse and harmful outputs, especially in projects serving vulnerable populations.
4. **Transparency**: Document model limitations and potential failure modes.

## Supported Versions

Generally, only the latest released version of each OpenImpactAI project is supported with security updates. If you are using an older version, please update to the most recent version.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as part of our regular release process and documented in project release notes with appropriate CVE identifiers when applicable.
