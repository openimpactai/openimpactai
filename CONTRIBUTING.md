## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

Most OpenImpactAI projects follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. We use `flake8` and `black` for code linting and formatting.

Before submitting a pull request, please run:

```bash
flake8 .
black .
```

### Documentation Style

- Use Markdown for documentation
- Follow the established documentation structure
- For Python docstrings, use the Google style:

```python
def function_with_types_in_docstring(param1, param2):
    """Example function with types documented in the docstring.
    
    Args:
        param1 (int): The first parameter.
        param2 (str): The second parameter.
    
    Returns:
        bool: The return value. True for success, False otherwise.
    """
    return True
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Community Involvement

### Special Considerations

When contributing to OpenImpactAI projects, please keep in mind:

1. **Inclusive Design**: Our projects aim to help diverse populations. Consider accessibility and inclusivity in all contributions.

2. **Ethical AI**: We develop AI solutions with careful attention to bias, fairness, and ethical considerations.

3. **Domain Expertise**: We highly value input from experts in education, healthcare, accessibility, and environmental science.

4. **Dataset Ethics**: Be mindful of ethical considerations around datasets, including consent, representation, and cultural sensitivity.

### Community Engagement

OpenImpactAI is more than a set of projectsâ€”it's a community:

- **Monthly Update Meetings**: Virtual sessions to discuss progress and next steps
- **Quarterly Planning**: Collaborative sessions to determine focus areas
- **Annual Hackathons**: Intensive development periods focused on specific challenges
- **Discussion Forums**: Spaces for both technical and domain-specific conversations
