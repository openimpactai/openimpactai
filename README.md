# ANNOUNCEMENT

We are pleased to announce that [GDLabs.io](https://gdlabs.io) has made the decision to transform our AI initiatives into open-source projects starting May 2025. We've begun by migrating our education-focused AI solutions to public repositories, and we're expanding our commitment to support a broader range of AI projects for social good. Through collaborations with universities and our community platform, [AI Builders Hub](https://aibuildershub.ai), we aim to advance our work in an open-source format. As part of this initiative, we are migrating our private repository projects to a public repository named "OpenImpactAI."
